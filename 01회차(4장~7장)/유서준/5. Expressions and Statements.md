# Chapter 5: Expressions and Statements

---

## 1. Understanding Values and Literals

### Values

- A value is the result of evaluating an expression.
- Values are stored in memory as binary data.
- Different data types can interpret the same binary data differently.

### Literals

- Literals are notations for representing fixed values in source code.
- Examples include number literals (3, 10.5), string literals ('Hello'), boolean literals (true, false), etc.
- Literals are evaluated to produce values at runtime.

## 2. Expressions

- An expression is a piece of code that can be evaluated to produce a value.
- Types of expressions include:
  - Literal expressions: `10`, `'Hello'`
  - Identifier expressions: `sum`, `person.name`
  - Operator expressions: `10 + 20`, `sum !== 10`
  - Function/method call expressions: `square()`, `person.getName()`
- Expressions can be used wherever values are expected in JavaScript.

## 3. Statements

- Statements are the basic units of a program and the smallest executable units.
- They are composed of one or more expressions and/or keywords.
- Types of statements include:
  - Declaration statements: `var x;`
  - Assignment statements: `x = 5;`
  - Function declaration statements: `function foo() {}`
  - Conditional statements: `if (x > 1) { console.log(x); }`
  - Loop statements: `for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) { console.log(i); }`

## 4. Semicolons and Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)

- Semicolons (;) indicate the end of a statement in JavaScript.
- They are optional due to ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion).
- ASI can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
- While there's debate, many style guides and tools recommend using explicit semicolons.

## 5. Expression Statements vs Non-Expression Statements

- Expression statements are statements that can be evaluated to produce a value.
- Non-expression statements cannot be evaluated to produce a value.
- A simple test: if you can assign it to a variable, it's an expression statement.
- Example:

  ```javascript
  // Expression statement (can be assigned)
  var a = x = 100;
  
  // Non-expression statement (cannot be assigned)
  var b = var x; // This will cause a SyntaxError
  ```
